# Installation

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the Cosmetic Clarity mobile application.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, you need to have the following software installed on your development machine:

* **Flutter SDK:** Ensure that you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured correctly. You can find the installation instructions for your operating system on the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* **Dart SDK:** The Dart SDK is bundled with the Flutter SDK, so you don't need to install it separately.
* **Android Studio or Visual Studio Code with Flutter/Dart plugins:** You will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed to develop and run Flutter applications.
    * **Android Studio:** Recommended for Android development. You can download it from: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    * **Visual Studio Code:** A lightweight and versatile editor. You can download it from: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the Flutter and Dart extensions from the marketplace.
* **Android SDK:** If you intend to run the application on an Android emulator or a physical Android device, you need to have the Android SDK installed via Android Studio. Ensure that you have at least Android API level 26 (Android 8.0 Oreo) installed, as this is the minimum supported version.
* **(Optional) Xcode:** If you intend to run the application on an iOS simulator or a physical iOS device, you will need Xcode installed on a macOS machine. You can download it from the Mac App Store. You will also need to configure your development certificate and provisioning profiles.
