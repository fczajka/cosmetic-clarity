### Explanation of Key Directories and Files

  * **`android/`**: Contains the Android-specific code for your application. This includes the AndroidManifest.xml, build.gradle files, and any native Android code if needed.
  * **`ios/`**: Contains the iOS-specific code for your application. This includes the Info.plist, AppDelegate.swift/Objective-C files, and any native iOS code if needed.
  * **`lib/`**: This is where the main Dart code for your Flutter application resides.
      * **`main.dart`**: The entry point of your application.
      * **`common/`**: Contains reusable widgets, theme definitions, utility functions, and other common elements used throughout the application.
          * **`widgets/`**: Generic and reusable UI components.
          * **`theme/`**: Defines the application's visual style, including colors, typography, and overall theme.
          * **`utils/`**: Helper functions and utility classes.
      * **`data/`**: Handles data-related logic.
          * **`models/`**: Defines the data structures (e.g., Ingredient, Scan).
          * **`repositories/`**: Abstracts the data source and provides a clean API for accessing data.
          * **`data_sources/`**: Handles communication with local databases, APIs, or other data sources.
      * **`presentation/`**: Contains the UI (user interface) layer of the application.
          * **`screens/`**: Contains the individual screens or views of the application (e.g., Home Screen, History Screen).

          * **`blocs/` / `providers/` / `cubits/`**: Contains the files for your chosen state management solution (you might only have one of these folders depending on your choice).
      * **`services/`**: Contains services that perform specific tasks, such as OCR processing, database interactions, or API calls.
          * **`ocr_service.dart`**: Handles the logic for performing Optical Character Recognition.
          * **`database_service.dart`**: Manages the local database for storing scan history and liked/disliked ingredients.
          * **`api_service.dart`**: Handles communication with any external APIs (if your application uses one for ingredient data).
      * **`routing/`**: Contains the navigation logic for the application.
          * **`app_router.dart`**: Defines the routes and navigation flow of the application.
      * **`... (other core files)`**: Any other important Dart files in the `lib` directory.
  * **`test/`**: Contains unit tests for your Dart code.
  * **`integration_test/`**: Contains integration tests for testing the application as a whole or major parts of it.
  * **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
  * **`pubspec.yaml`**: The project's configuration file, including dependencies, assets, and other project settings.
