# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future development and potential enhancements for the Cosmetic Clarity mobile application. The features are categorized into near-term and long-term goals.

## Near-Term Goals

These are features and improvements that are planned for implementation in the near future.

* **Improved OCR Accuracy:** Investigate and integrate more advanced OCR libraries or techniques to enhance the accuracy of ingredient scanning, especially for complex or poorly formatted ingredient lists.
* **Ingredient Database Enrichment:** Continuously expand the local ingredient database with more detailed information, including potential allergens, comedogenic ratings, and safety assessments from reputable sources.
* **User Account System (Optional):** Implement a basic user account system to allow users to save their scan history, liked/disliked ingredients across multiple devices (consider if this aligns with your immediate goals).
* **Enhanced "How to Use" Guide:** Improve the initial user experience by creating a more interactive and comprehensive "How to Use" guide, possibly with visual aids or a short tutorial.
* **Performance Optimizations:** Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in the application to ensure smooth and responsive user interactions.

## Long-Term Goals

These are more ambitious features and improvements that are planned for the longer term.

* **Real-time Ingredient Analysis:** Explore the possibility of real-time analysis of cosmetic product labels directly through the camera view, without requiring a separate scanning step.
* **Integration with External Databases:** Integrate with external, up-to-date databases of cosmetic ingredients to provide the most current and comprehensive information.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on a user's liked and disliked ingredients, and potentially their skin type or concerns (if collected), offer personalized recommendations for cosmetic products.
* **Community Features (Optional):** Explore the possibility of adding community features, such as allowing users to share their scans or contribute information about ingredients (consider the scope and moderation needs).
* **Platform Expansion:** Investigate the feasibility of expanding the application to other platforms, such as web or desktop, while maintaining a consistent user experience.
* **Accessibility Improvements:** Continuously improve the application's accessibility to ensure it is usable by individuals with disabilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines.

**Note:** This roadmap is subject to change based on development progress, user feedback, and evolving priorities.
